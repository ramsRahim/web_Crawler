An 18-year-old robber has been found guilty of murder after stabbing a 16-year-old boy in the leg while stealing his mobile phone in north London.Stelios Averkiou was sitting on a park bench with two friends when he was targeted by Kyi-Riece Sylvester, in Tottenham, in August last year.Sylvester, 18, knifed him and ran off with the mobile phone, the Old Bailey was told.A second 18-year-old, Leon Gruber, was cleared of murder and manslaughter.The robbery and attack happened during the day at Lordship Recreation Park.The pair on trial did not dispute they acted as a team when carrying out robberies, the court heard, but the jury had to decide whether Sylvester had meant to cause really serious harm and whether Mr Gruber had intentionally encouraged him.The trial heard that when the robbers "met with resistance from Stelios Averkiou, Sylvester stabbed him a number of times".The jury was told 16-year-old Stelios had lost consciousness at the scene and did not awake before he died nine days later.A post-mortem examination found his death was caused from blood loss after he sustained three stab wounds to the upper thigh, with one 16.5cm (6.5 inches) deep.Sylvester, from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, and Mr Gruber had both denied murder and an alternative offence of manslaughter.Sylvester will be sentenced at a later date.Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Tennis star Emma Raducanu has said she is "extremely grateful" after meeting the King and receiving her MBE. The 20-year-old was awarded the honour for services to tennis, at an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.Raducanu, from Bromley in south-east London, won the US Open in September 2021 when she was 18 years old.She became the first British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title since Virginia Wade in 1977 and the first qualifier of any nationality to do so.The former pupil at Newstead Wood School in Orpington beamed as she posed for pictures after meeting the King. In a statement issued by her agent, she said: "It's been great to receive my honour today from His Majesty the King - I feel extremely grateful."The Labour MP Dame Nia Griffith, who was conferred with her damehood at the same ceremony, said of Raducanu: "I think it is fantastic seeing a young person [achieve] the success that she had and I think obviously now she faces that incredibly challenging situation of coping with that success and coping also with disappointment."And I certainly think it is wonderful to see young people being praised and being rewarded and let's make sure we give every young person the opportunities so that they can develop their talents to the full."Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Firefighters in London will be the first to wear body-worn cameras following a report that found institutional racism and misogyny within London Fire Brigade (LFB).The report by former prosecutor Nazir Afzal found evidence of racist, homophobic and misogynistic bullying, which left a "clear trail of psychological harm".The review recommended LFB firefighters should wear cameras during home visits.Work would start immediately, LFB said.Speaking at a meeting of the London Assembly fire, resilience and emergency planning committee, LFB Commissioner Andy Roe said procurement of body-worn cameras had begun, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service."We will be the first service in the country to issue body-worn cameras to our crews, both to protect them but also to ensure public safety and reassurance. Those are immediate changes, and that change has started now," he said.In one testimony featured in the report, an anonymous female firefighter said she told her female friends "not to let male firefighters in the house", as they "go through women's drawers looking for underwear and sex toys". The firefighter said cameras were the "only way" to stop such behaviour.London Fire Brigade report: "If female firefighters aren't safe from men, neither are we"In addition to issuing firefighters with body-worn cameras, Mr Roe revealed a five-year case review had begun this week, looking back at historic cases to "sense check all of those decisions that got made"."If we still have people in the workforce, regardless of whether they've been through a process or not, who do not meet newly framed standards around gross misconduct, then they will be dismissed," he said.He added that, unlike in the Metropolitan Police, there were no "significant legal barriers" to dismissing members of staff that have been found to have committed misconduct.Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

A host of leading hospitals will be affected in next month's nurse strikes, the Royal College of Nursing says.They include Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey children's hospitals and leading cancer centres.Overall, more than a quarter of hospitals and community services in England and nearly all those in Northern Ireland and Wales will see nurses walkout on 15 and 20 December.Emergency care will continue to be provided during the strike action.In total, 76 NHS organisations will see nurses walk out.They include leading cancer centres the Royal Marsden and Liverpool's Clatterbridge centre alongside major hospitals in Birmingham, London, Liverpool, Newcastle and West Yorkshire.All the health boards in Northern Ireland and all-but-one in Wales, the Aneurin Bevan, will see strike action take place.But action has been suspended in Scotland after ministers there made a fresh pay offer, which the RCN is consulting on.Meanwhile, Unison has announced ambulance staff including paramedics and call handlers, have voted to strike in five of England's 10 ambulance services. A walkout is expected before Christmas.Turnout was too low in the remainder for the votes to count, as well as in all but two of England's hospital and community trusts.No services in Wales voted for strike action, but a walkout will happen across all services in Northern Ireland on 12 December, Unison said.Your device may not support this visualisationOverall, up to 100,000 nurses could be involved in the nurse walkout the RCN says, which would amount to about a quarter of nurses in those three nations.The RCN warned the government if a deal could not be agreed more services would be involved in the strike action next year.RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: "Ministers have declined my offer of formal pay negotiations and instead chosen strike action."It has left us with no choice. Nursing is standing up for the profession and their patients. "We've had enough of being taken for granted and being unable to provide the care patients deserve."Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' payThe strike action will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT.Under trade union laws, the RCN has to ensure life-preserving careThis is likely to mean some cancer services, urgent tests and scans and ongoing care for vulnerable patients will be protected alongside A&E and intensive care - although it will be up to local health bosses and union leaders to negotiate exact staffing levels on strike days.But it seems almost certain the walkout will increase the backlog in non-urgent hospital treatment - a record seven million people are already on the waiting list in England.GP services, however, will be unaffected as nurses working in practices were not entitled to take part in the ballot.In England, the RCN only has mandates for strike action in just over half of NHS trusts as the turnout was too low in the rest.For the forthcoming strikes the union's leadership has decided to only announce walkouts in around half of those eligible to take action.The RCN has called for a rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at above 14%, but no UK nation has offered close to that.In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been given a rise of at least £1,400 - worth about 4% on average for nurses.In Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award because there is no working government.Earlier this month Scottish ministers made a fresh offer worth more than 8% for a newly-qualified nurse, with more senior nurses being offered less. This prompted the re-starting of talks.During the ballot - the results of which were announced two weeks ago - the RCN had argued this year's below-inflation pay award came after years of squeezes on nurse's salaries. But England Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said the RCN's demands are not affordable.He has said the government had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award.And it followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze.The Welsh government said it was unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.This will only be the second time RCN members have been on strike.In 2019, nurses in Northern Ireland walked out over pay, while nurses who are members of Unison in England walked out in 2014 over pay.A host of other major health unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite, have all started balloting members.Nurses' pay: How much do you know?

Rozanne Cooper (l) and Makayah McDermott both died in the crash in August 2016At a glanceA Met Police officer accused of causing the deaths of two people during a car pursuit has told a court he "just wanted to help people"PC Edward Welch was pursuing a stolen car in Penge, south-east London, when it crashed into Makayah McDermott and Rozanne CooperThe Old Bailey heard the officer's car reached speeds of more than 60mph during the chaseT﻿he 34-year-old denies two counts of causing death by dangerous drivingA Met Police officer accused of causing the deaths of a 10-year-old boy and his aunt during a car chase has told a court he "just wanted to help people".
PC Edward Welch was pursuing a stolen car in Penge, south-east London, on 31 August 2016 when it mounted the pavement and hit child actor Makayah McDermott and Rozanne Cooper.The officer, from Chatham, Kent, told the Old Bailey he had joined the force at the age of 20 because he wanted to "stop bad coming into the world". The 34-year-old denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving, one count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, and an alternative charge of dangerous driving.The court heard that PC Welch, who has been based in the borough of Bromley throughout his policing career, had been involved in five pursuits of up to an hour in length before the fatal crash.Explaining why he had joined the Met, he told the jury: "I have always wanted to be a police officer. It was my dream as a child. It's all I've ever wanted to do.﻿"I just wanted to help people. That is what police do - stop bad coming into the world, helping people."Joshua Dobby's car mounted the pavement and crushed Makayah, Ms Cooper and another 10-year-old child who survivedThe court heard how during the six-minute chase through residential and one-way streets, PC Welch's police BMW car reached speeds of more than 60mph (97km/h).Describing what happened on the day of the pursuit, PC Welch said he was notified that a lost or stolen Ford Focus had activated an ANPR camera on Penge High Street, and then spotted the car when he and his colleague had been responding to a traffic collision.H﻿e told jurors: "I activated my blue lights and sirens to safely facilitate myself through the traffic towards the subject vehicle," which he said was "driving at excess speed on Mackenzie Road".The court heard PC Welch would speak out loud to focus his mind and he described his concentration at the time as being "through the roof".H﻿e also said he assessed the risk of the pursuit at one point as "low", because "visibility was good" and the road he was on was straight.The prosecution has claimed that by "any sensible analysis, the risk posed by the pursuit, taking account of the driving of both vehicles, was at a higher level of risk".The Old Bailey has previously heard the car being chased was driven by a 19-year-old, Joshua Dobby, who lost control of the vehicle on Lennard Road and crashed into Makayah, 34-year-old Ms Cooper and another 10-year-old, who was left with serious injuries.Dobby was later convicted of two counts of manslaughter by gross negligence and one count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.T﻿he trial continues.Follow BBC London on Facebook, external, Twitter, external and Instagram, external.

An anonymous hotline will be set up for people to report Met Police officers and staff for corruption, abuse and other breaches of trust or power.Recent scandals to hit the force include strip-searching children, the murder of Sarah Everard, and the sharing of pictures of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman after they were killed.Officers have been convicted of a string of offences including sex crimes, theft and assault.The line will be run by Crimestoppers.In addition to criminal activity, there was also outrage over racist and misogynist messages shared by police based at Charing Cross.A watchdog found the force's anti-corruption systems to be not fit for purpose, and a review of disciplinary procedures said officers and staff were getting away with misconduct and breaking the law.Commander James Harman, head of the anti-corruption and abuse command, said having the hotline could "further erode trust in the Met as more allegations come to light", but confronting the issues was the right course of action."We have to improve and rebuild the public's trust rather than hide from it," he added.Information received will be passed to a team who will assess it and, where necessary, given to detectives to begin an investigation.Allegations to the freephone number - 0800 085 0000 - can be made anonymously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This move demonstrates the seriousness of the situation facing the new Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley as he attempts to restore public trust.He had already announced the creation of an anti-corruption and abuse unit to investigate allegations made via the hotline. He has previously spoken of his frustration about how difficult it can be to get rid of officers, calling for more governmental powers over disciplinary processes. The public will need to feel confident that not only are their concerns taken seriously but that corrupt officers will be removed from the force.Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

A Hackney community will be able to donate their energy rebates to neighbours struggling with energy bills in a new heat exchange scheme.Local councillor Penny Wrout set up the scheme in Victoria and Wick after seeing its success in De Beauvoir, where residents raised over £3,500.The scheme is organised through the Fuel Bank Foundation.Hackney residents are entitled to £12.3m in unclaimed pensions credit a year - the highest in London.Every household is getting £400 in energy support payments, made in six instalments, under the Energy Bills Support Scheme.Residents over the age of 66 are also eligible for a winter fuel allowance of up to £600.Ms Wrout said some residents wanted to use the money they receive to help others in the neighbourhood.She noted that some people on fixed tariffs could see their energy bills dropping, while others in Hackney are worried about the rise in energy costs."There are people who are better placed to help others," she explained. "Some in our neighbourhood are on fixed tariffs from their gas and electricity suppliers so may not immediately face the energy price hikes, while others are high earners."I'm hoping they'll see the heat exchange as an effective way to support their wider community."The Well Street Common Neighbourhood Area will be distributing any money raised to people of all ages.Six tips for cutting home energy bills this winterHow are other countries tackling energy bills?Half of UK households face fuel poverty, claims EDFULEZ zone to be expanded to the whole of London, the Mayor announces | Jonathan PiresCost-of-surviving crisis: Now people can’t afford to wash hairMartin Lewis slams politicians and the parliamentary systemProportion of population describing themselves as Christian falls below 50% for first time, ONS revealsSubstance 'sprayed at' staff in Romford jewellers robberySurvey Shows Some Dissatisfaction with GPs in Ealing BoroughNato pledges Ukraine arms and power grid supportChina plans 'crackdown' after Covid protestsJailed Belarus protest leader 'in intensive care'Philippines sees a pandemic boom in child sex abuseFive dramatic days of protests across China.

A lido has urged swimmers to spend less time in the water, after seeing at least one hypothermia case a day over the past week.Parliament Hill Lido in Hampstead, north London, issued the warning on its Facebook page after lifeguards noticed a rise in cases.Cold water swimming has increased in popularity amid reports about its numerous health benefits.But it can be dangerous for inexperienced swimmers.A member of the Parliament Hill Lido User Group asked swimmers to avoid spending too long in the water in light of the recent hypothermia cases."The lifeguard team have asked you all to be careful and to shorten your swim from now on," the user wrote."We have had at least one hypothermic incident every day for the last week."Swimmers were also warned not to use the saunas to warm up if they got into trouble."Everyone that has got into difficulties this week has tried using the sauna to warm themselves up. It does not always work, and sometimes makes warming up more complicated."The lido told the BBC that although none of the cases was serious enough to require hospital treatment, the lifeguards were taken away from their other duties, putting swimmers at risk.One member of the swimmers' group said they had seen the lifeguards "calmly handle two emergencies within a 15-minute period".Emma Rea, co-chair of the Parliament Hill User Group, asked swimmers to "listen to their body" and "recognise that you are not there to push yourself to the limits".She told BBC London the lido had been "rather inundated by people wanting to try out this new 'craze' of winter swimming in recent years".Ms Rea advised new swimmers to consider the temperature before entering the pool, and not to go in if they had been drinking or had not slept enough the night before.A spokesperson for the Hampstead Heath charity reminded visitors that "there are risks associated with cold water swimming, even for regular winter swimmers"."We are advising people to swim with care and only spend a short amount of time in the water."For more information on how to stay safe while cold water swimming, please see the RNLI's advice here.Can cold water swimming treat depression?Pain stopped by cold open water plungeLido 'astonished' by demand for cold water swimsULEZ zone to be expanded to the whole of London, the Mayor announces | Jonathan PiresCost-of-surviving crisis: Now people can’t afford to wash hairMartin Lewis slams politicians and the parliamentary systemProportion of population describing themselves as Christian falls below 50% for first time, ONS revealsSubstance 'sprayed at' staff in Romford jewellers robberySurvey Shows Some Dissatisfaction with GPs in Ealing BoroughNato pledges Ukraine arms and power grid supportChina plans 'crackdown' after Covid protestsJailed Belarus protest leader 'in intensive care'Philippines sees a pandemic boom in child sex abuseFive dramatic days of protests across China.

For the first time fewer than half of people in England and Wales describe themselves as Christian, the Census 2021 has revealed. The proportion of people who said they were Christian was 46.2%, down from 59.3% in the last census in 2011.In contrast the number who said they had no religion increased to 37.2% of the population, up from a quarter.Those identifying as Muslim rose from 4.9% in 2011 to 6.5% last year.People were also asked about their ethnic group and national identity - the responses of which were released in the results just published.The census is carried out every 10 years by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).People were asked the broad question what their religion was rather than being asked more specifically about their beliefs or religious practices, in the voluntary question included in the census since 2001.Ticking "no religion" does not mean having no beliefs, says Prof Linda Woodhead, from King's College London."Some will be atheist, a lot will be agnostic - they just say, 'I don't really know' - and some will be spiritual and be doing spiritual things." she said.Separately when people were asked about their ethnic group, 81.7% of residents in England and Wales identified as White, down from 86.0% a decade earlier, according to the census.And 74.4% of the total population identified as White as well as English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British.The next most common ethnic group was Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh accounting for 9.3% of the overall population - 5.5 million people, up from 4.2 million. The number of people identifying as Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African was 2.5% of the population, up from 1.8%, taking the figure from 990,000 to 1.5 million.One in 10 of households across England and Wales are now made up of people from two or more different ethnic groups - an increase from 8.7%.And Luton, Birmingham and Leicester. are among 14 areas in England where people identifying as White are now in the minority.In terms of national identity, among those who described it as not being the UK, the most common response was Polish, followed by Romanian.It may feel like a pivotal moment, with the census showing fewer than half of people in England and Wales identifying as Christian, but for years social surveys have shown a rapid rise in those who define themselves as having no religion, often reporting that as the largest category - that is not the case in the census data. With its very simple optional question, "What is your religion?", the census does not illustrate the range of 22.2 million people in the "no religion" category; from those who do not believe in god at all to those who do in some form, or believe in the power of prayer and an afterlife or are spiritual in some way.The trend away from faith is not something that is reflected in major non-Christian religions which all saw a rise, with more than 1.2 million more people identifying as Muslim in England and Wales in 2021 as compared to 2011. As with ethnicity, patterns of family size and immigration are seen as contributory factors.Of those who chose to write in their answer under the "any other religion" option, the largest group identified as Pagan, with a tenfold rise from 2011 in those identifying themselves as Shaman.In terms of religion, London is the most religiously diverse region of England, with just over 25.3% of people reporting a religion other than Christianity.And south-west England is shown to be the least religiously diverse region, with 3.2% selecting a religion other than Christian.The figures also showed differences in nations - in England alone, 37.2% of people said they had no religion, while in Wales this rose to 46.5% from 32.1% in 2011. Following the announcement, the Archbishop of York said the country had "left behind the era when many people almost automatically identified as Christian".The Most Rev Stephen Cottrell said: "It's not a great surprise that the census shows fewer people in this country identifying as Christian than in the past, but it still throws down a challenge to us not only to trust that God will build his kingdom on Earth but also to play our part in making Christ known."Your device may not support this visualisationHe said that, facing a cost-of-living crisis and war in Europe, people still needed spiritual guidance, adding: "We will be there for them, in many cases, providing food and warmth."Chief executive of Humanists UK Andrew Copson added the figures should be a "wake-up call which prompts fresh reconsiderations of the role of religion in society"."No state in Europe has such a religious set-up as we do in terms of law and public policy, while at the same time having such a non-religious population."The census explores how British society is being shaped from people's answers to questions about themselves, their household and their home.The results help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services including transport, education and healthcare.The 2021 survey, carried out on March 21 last year, was filled out by more than 24 million households across England and Wales. More data from the census is set to be published in stages over the next two years.Scotland's census was due to take place in 2021 but was delayed by a year due to the Covid pandemic.Population of England and Wales up 6% in a decade'Our home is one of the UK's most diverse cities'People more satisfied with life in Wales - surveyUK net migration hits all-time record at 504,000Nato pledges Ukraine arms and power grid supportChina plans 'crackdown' after Covid protestsJailed Belarus protest leader 'in intensive care'Philippines sees a pandemic boom in child sex abuseFive dramatic days of protests across China.

The boss of the pub chain Fuller's has told the BBC that rail strikes could see Christmas parties cancelled unless there is a "speedy resolution".Simon Emeny also warned that staff who rely on hours and tips over Christmas could suffer if there is a wave of cancelled bookings.He urged the RMT to cancel the upcoming strikes to make sure the sector "can have the Christmas it deserves".The union recently announced fresh strikes in the run-up to Christmas.In the latest move in the ongoing row over pay, working conditions and job security for rail workers, industrial action will be held across four 48-hour periods on 13-14 and 16-17 December, and 3-4 and 6-7 January.Mr Emeny said that the action could dent trade in a "vital" Christmas period and see customers cancel plans."It's been a challenging two or three years for hospitality, so we are all looking at this Christmas as a chance to trade well ahead of what will probably be a tricky winter and these train strikes are going to impact the hospitality sector - but more importantly, hospitality workers," he told the BBC."They will probably have hours cut, see tips significantly reduced if these train strikes still happen. We are positive about Christmas but the train strikes are a big problem for the sector."He added that bookings for Christmas parties and lunches across the pub and hotel chain had been "absolutely excellent" so far.The firm, which employs more than 5,000 people, has so far been telling customers that it believes the strikes could be cancelled or postponed."There's only so long we can delay those enquiries about cancelling and really what we need is a speedy resolution - not a resolution at the last minute because people will have changed their plans by then," Mr Emeny said.The RMT union said last week that its strike action would send "a clear message" that workers want a better deal.More than 40,000 RMT members across Network Rail and 14 train companies are expected to take part.Pub boss Charlie Baker told the BBC parties and celebrations across its two sites in Hammersmith and Shoreditch in London have already been called off in the run-up to the strikesHe estimates about £200,000 of business has been cancelled since the announcement. "Customers are generally very sorry - we've seen parties of up to 150 people cancelled. It's ruining Christmas for them and they can't do anything about it. For big companies that book these parties, if it's logistically impossible for your workers to get there, it's not worth shelling out money for."As a smaller business owner, he said the loss of business was "scary".With pubs, restaurants and cafes facing a "cliff edge" with energy bills set to go up further in the spring, Charlie says the strike action has made building up a buffer of cash more difficult."I totally understand the cost of living is going up, and empathise with the rail workers, but it's really tough for us too," he said.The hospitality trade body recently warned that the strike action will cost the sector about £1.5bn in lost sales.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, wrote to the transport secretary calling on government to help rail bosses come to an agreement, pointing out that it is a lucrative time of year for workers who make good tips and can work additional overtime because of extra demand from customers."The impact of rail strikes already this year has been devastating and wide-reaching, but this will pale in comparison to what we will see as a result of the upcoming strikes in December," she said."These strikes damage all parts of society and it's now time that the government proactively brings all partners to the table to deliver a solution that protects the nation's workers and hospitality customers this Christmas."The RMT union's general secretary Mick Lynch said the "lack of urgency from the government" in tackling the issues as "astonishing".In a letter to business bosses and the hospitality industry, he wrote: "We understand the impact that these rail strikes are having on your sector at this time of year, yet while you face disruption to your business at this critical time, the private rail businesses we are in dispute with will not lose a penny."The union is expected to meet Rail Minister Huw Merriman later this week.On Monday, Transport Secretary Mark Harper welcomed his recent talks with Mr Lynch."I want to work with you and employers in good faith to help resolve these long-standing issues, and help the employers and you reach a resolution that is fair to all,"he said.Responding to Mr Lynch's comments, the Department for Transport said Mr Harper had written to the RMT leader to set out "how he can facilitate the RMT and employers to reach an agreement and end the dispute for the benefit of taxpayers and the travelling public"..

In 1981 Rita Marley’s brother Leroy Anderson aka Lepke launched the Dread Broadcasting Corporation (DBC), Europe’s first dedicated black music station.  Frustrated by the lack of airtime for reggae music in the UK, Lepke setup a mast in his back garden and began to broadcast to a small area of West London every Sunday afternoon. DBC soon expanded to cover all styles of black music and with its unmistakable logo featuring a dread with headphones and a spliff became a trailblazer for the future of black British radio in the UK. Carmella Jervier aka Sister C told Witness History how hearing black female DJs like the Ranking Miss P on DBC inspired her to become a DJ.Witness History: The stories of our times told by the people who were there.

A north London property developer has swapped his hard hat for a bee suit in his bid to protect wildlife.Khalid Undre, 57, bought a plot of land in Harrow more than a decade ago and began to grow crops and took up beekeeping to pollinate his plants. He started with six hives and now has more than 300 spread between his honey farm in Harrow and other locations across the capital, like Enfield and Holland Park. Mr Undre is passionate about protecting the local environment and hopes to have 500 beehives by the end of next year. He says there's plenty of room for more beehives and beekeepers in London, and it's something more people should be taking up.Video by Suhail Patel.Meet the London property developer turned beekeeper.

Last updated on 5 hours ago5 hours ago.From the section BoxingChris Eubank Jr says he will only need to show "50% of what I can do" to beat Liam Smith in their middleweight fight in Manchester on 21 January.Eubank, 33, will be fighting for the first time since his bout with Conor Benn was cancelled in October.Speaking at a news conference, he taunted fellow Briton Smith, saying he was an easier opponent than Benn."Conor was an unknown, unpredictable, young and undefeated," he said. "I know what Liam is."Eubank was wearing a jacket emblazoned with the logos of a fast-food chain he said had promised to provide him as much fried chicken as he could eat while in training camp.And the former IBO super-middleweight champion wasted no time in trying to agitate 34-year-old Smith."I think 50% of what I can do will be enough to beat Liam," he said."The bad guy is back. He never cheats, he never lies, he never cuts any corners but he's still the bad guy."Smith - a former world champion at light-middleweight - responded: "If he turns up at 50%, I'll wipe the floor with him."For a news conference about Eubank v Smith, Benn's name was never far from anyone's lips.It has been almost two months since it emerged Benn had failed two voluntary drug tests and his fight with Eubank was postponed two days before it was due to take place. He has since given up his boxing licence and now faces a legal battle to clear his name.Eubank has moved on quickly to another domestic rival, but the Benn saga predictably cast a big shadow over his return to the public eye.He opened the news conference with a thinly veiled dig at Benn - who insists he is a "clean" fighter - by saying he "never cheats" and "never cuts corners".Smith, too, was eager to bring up Benn - asking why there was a rematch clause for this fight, but hadn't been when Eubank fought Benn.And, of course, there is the fact Eubank's "50%" and KFC taunts were ideas born as he verbally sparred with Benn.While Smith v Eubank may not command the same fanfare as Eubank v Benn, the fight is an intriguing encounter.Both men have 32 wins, are separated in age by just a year, and know how to put on a thrilling fight. Both are in excellent form - Smith with three stoppage wins in a row and Eubank on a six-fight winning streak. The fight has all the hallmarks of an all-British classic, even if the ghost of Eubank v Benn continues to linger.Watch gripping new drama starring David Tennant and Stanley Tucci on BBC iPlayerIn a brave and compelling documentary Zara McDermott goes in search of answersA revealing documentary chronicling the Brazilian football star's life on and off the pitch

Last updated on 12 hours ago12 hours ago.From the section CricketWill Jacks hits the ball a long way, is "an absolute gun in the field" and his part-time off-spin could be a vital weapon on England's Test tour of Pakistan.So it's no surprise a man once thought of as a potential Twenty20 international has found his way into England's new-look Test set-up, spearheaded by captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum.Indeed, he might have secured himself a place in the starting XI with his blistering 84 off 48 against England Lions last week. It came weeks after he was named MVP by the The Professional Cricketers' Associationexternal-link for his domestic performances in 2022."He can either go in from ball one and smash it, or he can go in at 7 and bat with the tail, see it out and then go mad at the end," says cricket commentator Mark Church."The way he plays his cricket, I think he'll fit perfectly into the McCullum-Stokes system."For a good portion of the past few years, 23-year-old Jacks has looked more and more ready for a spot in England's side, especially in white-ball cricket.A haul of 146 runs in the first edition of The Hundred in 2021 spoke of a player who was developing to a good level, as did 393 runs, including three half-centuries, in the T20 Blast.The season just gone saw Jacks blow his figures in each of those competitions out of the water: the Surrey man hit 261 runs in The Hundred, as well as blasting his way to a best score of 108* against Southern Brave - only the second instance of a player reaching three figures in the competition.In the Blast, Jacks smashed 449 runs, passing the half-century mark on five occasions. In fact, only established England stars Jos Buttler and Alex Hales, as well as Pakistan ace Shan Masood, had hit more runs in T20s than Jacks' tally of 1,193 in 2022 at the time of his maiden international call-up for England's summer T20 series against Pakistan.Add 648 first-class runs alongside 17 wickets to those numbers in 2022, and you're looking at a player developing into a true all-format star.Here, some of those who know him best detail what makes him special.Mike Tilley is a former Guildford Cricket Club age group manager. Tilley managed a young Jacks for many years, including during a triumphant season in the National U15 T20 Cup."He played a big part in a number of the rounds [in the National Cup]. He scored 50 in the semi-final very quickly and another 30-odd in the final," Tilley recalls."I particularly remember in the final, the opposition had a quick opening bowler who had pretty much bowled his team to the final. I told him just to be careful against him."He replied 'he's not quick', and dispatched him back over his head in the first over."Both at club and county level, Jacks has frequently been star of the show, and Tilley remembers one instance where the batter showed his true prowess."I remember him scoring a double hundred for Surrey under-17s. The second hundred came in less than an hour."He definitely gave you the impression he was going to become a pro from an early age - he always worked at every aspect of his game in training: especially his batting, but he always wanted to play a part in the game, which I think is why he is such a good fielder and why at 15 he started bowling off-spin. "He always had a touch of arrogance about him, but was a good team man."Corey Rocchiccioli played a season of Western Australia Premier Cricket with Jacks for Western Australia University in 2018, and lived with him during that period.Rocchiccioli recalls Jacks' first major contribution in first-grade cricket - a double ton against Claremont-Nedlands, after he was dismissed for a golden duck the week prior."He just brushed it [the duck] off and made a double hundred the following week. He just had one of those flow-state games, he really enjoyed batting out there. There was some conversation about him knowing exactly what he was on, he was counting his runs all the way up until his double hundred."I don't think I've played with somebody who has found the middle of the bat as much as he does, or hits it as hard. He's just an exceptional cricketer."He ended up making 600 or 700 runs; he left midway through January to be called up for the England Lions, but he was on track for a thousand-run season. He'd have done it pretty comfortably."Off the field, Rocchiccioli feels Jacks is as good a character as he is on it, despite some questionable skills around the house."It took a while for us to get him to learn how to cook, there were some very sketchy moments with him in the kitchen."One is Test level and the other is playing the lowest division ever, you can work out which is which between his cricket skills and his cheffing skills."His banter around the house was really good - me and my family like to give it so he slotted in perfectly. He probably gave it back as much as he got it, we gave him plenty of stick around the joint, especially after he made his double hundred, to get his head back down to earth."Middlesex batter Max Holden captained Jacks for England Under-19s, as well as playing with him for England Lions."I didn't utilise his bowling skills as much as I probably should have, but with the bat, at that age, he led the way with that positive intent in the middle order."[He was] unbelievable the way he went through the gears, the array of shots that he had. He hit it pretty much all around the ground, which obviously very few people can do. It looked relatively low risk, yet he scored so quickly."It's so hard to set a field to him because he can hit the ball anywhere really with such power and precision - he's not just someone who goes out there and just swings and whacks it, he's quite precise in the way he goes about it - obviously he has enormous power when he does strike it."He's a very efficient player of spin, he's got pretty much every shot in the book, so I think he'll adapt his game out there [the subcontinent]. Sometimes coming into the middle and starting against spin can be a different challenge to opening up in England."He's got the ability to hit the ball around the ground, manipulate the field and if he wants to he can clear the ropes off the spinner as well."He used to hit me out the nets quite a bit. He's obviously quite a tall guy so he can hit you off your length quite easily. It's quite hard to know the accurate length to bowl because if you pitch it up he can come down the wicket but if you go too short he can rock back and hit the ball over the boundaries off the back foot."I think that's something the best players in the world can do, guys at Middlesex who've come here, like [AB] De Villiers: they can hit spin off the back foot, which is something I think is quite rare, and is the sign of an international player from what I've seen. Jacksy can certainly do that."The way England are going with their Test cricket, the way they are looking to play that positive, exciting brand of cricket, I think he'd fit in perfectly." Mark Church, a BBC cricket journalist, has watched and interacted with Jacks for years while commentating on Surrey matches."He's very focused, he's very determined, and he's very much his own man, which I really, really like."He likes responsibility, and I think because Surrey have told him 'this is your job' that has probably simplified it for him: he knew he was the go-to."This season, his development has been absolutely fascinating. He's an incredibly talented lad, but I think we all knew the talent was there."We all know what he can do in white-ball cricket, we've seen that over the years. The hundred he got in The Hundred: it just showed what his game is about."In terms of red-ball cricket, the path he's going on now isn't one I thought would happen."With the bat, he's everything I expected really. With the ball - there's a lot of people who call him a part-time spinner, I've never gone down that route because he's far better than that. Like any young spinner, he's a work in progress, but he's a genuine spin bowler."He's an absolute gun in the field, you can put him anywhere.
